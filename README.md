# Marketing: Analysis and Predictions using CDNow Dataset
This is a personal project meant to utilize Data Analysis and Data Science strategies on customer data for the purpose of informing marketing decisions.

#### -- Project Status: [In-Progress]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is cluster and segment customer groups based on spending patterns as well as predict future customer spend.



### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering: RFM
* Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning: Clustering

* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, Numpy jupyter
* SciKit-Learn
* Dash

## Project Description
The CDNOW dataset contains the entire purchase history of a cohort of 23,570 individuals who made their first-ever purchase at CDNOW in the first quarter of 1997. Although CDNOW closed in June 1998, the non-synthetic dataset is similar to datasets used by marketing analysts for analyzing and predicting customer purchases.
